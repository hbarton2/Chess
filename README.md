I wanted to make some sort of machine learning based Chess project, so I started by making a working Chess game. I realized while making the chess game that implementing maching learning (at least a neural network) would be pretty hard and inconvenient. As of now I have just a chess game but I will hopefully make a chess engine at some point :)

I made the gui and visuals with pygame, eveything besides that is basic Python functionality. It is probably pretty messy and inefficient as this is my first real solo project.
